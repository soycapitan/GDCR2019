# GDCR2019
Some materials from our Coderetreat session in 2019

You can find here the code that was a result of guided session where I coded and explained all the decisions I made to the class and also code contributed by one of the teams that won the contests for the shortest sourcecode. Both programs are writtetn in Python. Enjoy!
